# trove

#### Trove aims to create:

1. A multi-platform desktop search app
2. Provide an UI that is close to the browser experience
3. Will not not be limited to full-text search but try to incorporate advanced algorithms for searching opaque objects

Software that Trove will leverage:

Multi-platform GUI : Electron – https://electronjs.org/
Full-text indexing : We are experimenting with SphinxSearch (http://sphinxsearch.com/) and Apache Lucene (https://lucene.apache.org/core/)
For text extraction: Apache Tika – https://tika.apache.org/
